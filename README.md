# The-Bridge-and-Torch-Puzzle-
To find the minimum time required for all four people to cross the bridge, follow these steps:
The two fastest people (1 and 2 minutes) cross the bridge together with the torch, taking 2 minutes.
The fastest person (1 minute) takes the torch and returns, taking 1 minute.
The two slowest people (10 and 5 minutes) cross the bridge together with the torch, taking 10 minutes.
The second fastest person (2 minutes) takes the torch and returns, taking 2 minutes.
Finally, the two fastest people (1 and 2 minutes) cross the bridge together one more time, taking 2 minutes.
In total, the minimum time required for all four people to cross the bridge is 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.
